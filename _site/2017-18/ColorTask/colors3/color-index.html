            <p>Here I am using three colors: white, light blue (with a tint of violet), and dark purple.</p> 
            
            <p>This is the second design after designing with two colors. At the beginning I couldn't design with three colors without having the guidance of two. That's why I did them in reversed order.</p>
            
            <p>Once I had the interface with two colors, I decided to change just the text's color to the dark purple and remove the white border line around the content area. This will make white just a color for the buttons. Light blue violet for the background. And dark purple for the text. </p>

            <p> I find that using three colors makes everything look better distributed and cleaner. Each color has like an specific job instead of several jobs like the two color design page where white was text, buttons, and content border, and where light blue was both button text and background.</p>
